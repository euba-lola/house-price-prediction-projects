# 🏡 House Price Prediction Projects

This repository presents two structured data science projects focused on predicting house prices using linear regression models. The projects walk through the complete data science workflow—from data cleaning and visualization to feature engineering and model evaluation.

Each notebook applies machine learning principles to explore how structural and locational attributes impact property values.

## 📌 Projects Included

### 🔹 Project 1: House Analysis and Predictions

This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on a real estate dataset and builds a linear regression model to predict property values. Key highlights include:

- Univariate and bivariate analysis of housing features
- Log transformation to address data skewness
- Correlation heatmap for feature selection
- Linear regression model with R², MAE, and MSE evaluation

### 🔹 Project 2: Price Prediction Model

A more streamlined project that focuses on clean feature engineering, normalization, and modeling accuracy. It includes:

- Log transformation of numerical predictors
- Correlation analysis and multicollinearity checks
- Linear regression implementation and residual error analysis
- Model performance evaluation with key metrics

📄 **Notebook:** `Project_2_Price_Prediction/price-prediction.ipynb`
